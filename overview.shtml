      <p>The course will cover most of the topics in 
      <a href="http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/current/courses/course_descriptions/cDescr/CS442.shtml">the
      handbook description</a>, though the order will be rearranged.
      The Winter 2014 offering will most resemble the Winter 2012 offering
      by the same instructor, though there is also considerable
      resemblance to offerings in winters 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007,
      2008, 2010, and 2013. Relative to all past offerings, we will be
      spending more time with the required textbook (Types and
      Programming Languages, by Benjamin Pierce), with more emphasis
      on type theory, and more emphasis on depth at the expense of
      some depth.
      <p>We will study three programming languages: Racket, OCaml, and
      Haskell. Each of these contributes significant concepts
      which can be rigourously formalized. Our goal is to understand
      not only the idiomatic use of these languages, but also their
      theoretical underpinnings, and issues that arise in their
      implementations. 
      <p>The first lecture module will give a few more details on the
      scope of coverage of topics.
