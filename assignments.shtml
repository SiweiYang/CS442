      <p>Assignment questions will be posted here as the term
      progresses. Submission instructions are
      on <a href="marmoset.shtml">the Marmoset page</a>. Work is to be
      done individually. Please avoid excessive collaboration, and do
      not look for the answers to assignment questions on the Web or
      in other textbooks. You are responsible for reading and
      understanding the policies described below under the heading
      "Plagiarism Policy".
      <p> Questions will not be grouped into weekly assignments, but
      released individually with individual due dates, 
      allowing for a more steady workload. 
      I anticipate having the equivalent of six to eight conventional
      assignments, with a
      workload that is moderate compared to other fourth-year CS
      courses. Programming will be done in Racket, OCaml, and Haskell.
      Students will be expected to program in these languages
      after lectures providing a relatively brief high-level overview
      of features. No language will be "dropped" (that is, later
      questions may involve programming in any or several of these).

      <h3>Plagiarism Policy </h3>

      <p>All work for credit in CS 442 is to be done individually. The penalty
      for plagiarism is an assigned mark of zero on the assignment or
      test and a deduction of 5% from the final course grade,
      consistent with School of Computer Science and Faculty of
      Mathematics policy. In addition, a letter detailing the offense
      is sent to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies, meaning
      that subsequent offenses will carry more severe penalties, up to
      suspension or expulsion. To avoid inadvertently incurring this
      penalty, you should discuss assignment issues with other
      students only in a very broad and high-level fashion. Do not
      take notes during such discussions, and avoid looking at anyone
      else's code, on screen or on paper. If you find yourself stuck,
      contact the instructor or teaching assistants for help, instead of getting the
      solution from someone else. When trying to deal with
      difficulties, do not consult books other than the textbooks and
      do not consult any Web sources, unless explicitly authorized to do so.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Senate Undergraduate Council has asked us to post the following paragraphs:</p> 

      <p><b>Academic Integrity:</b>  In order to maintain a culture of
      academic integrity, members of the University of Waterloo
      community are expected to promote honesty, trust, fairness,
      respect and responsibility. 
      <p><b>Grievance:</b>  A student who believes that a decision
      affecting some aspect of his/her university life has been unfair
      or unreasonable may have grounds for initiating a
      grievance. Read       <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy70.htm">Policy 70 - Student Petitions and Grievances, Section 4</a>.
      <p><b>Discipline:</b> A student is expected to know what
      constitutes academic integrity, to avoid committing academic
      offenses, and to take responsibility for his/her actions. A
      student who is unsure whether an action constitutes an offense,
      or who needs help in learning how to avoid offenses (e.g.,
      plagiarism, cheating) or about "rules" for group
      work/collaboration should seek guidance from the course
      professor, academic advisor, or the Undergraduate Associate
      Dean. When misconduct has been found to have occurred,
      disciplinary penalties will be imposed under Policy 71 - Student
      Discipline. For information on categories of offenses and types
      of penalties, students should refer to <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy71.htm">Policy 71 - Student Discipline</a>.
      <p><b>Avoiding Academic Offenses:</b>  
      Most students are unaware of the line between acceptable and
	unacceptable academic behaviour, especially when discussing
	assignments with classmates and using the work of other
	students.  For information on commonly misunderstood academic
	offenses and how to avoid them, students should refer to the
	<a
	href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/Current/cheating_policy.shtml">Faculty
	of Mathematics Cheating and Student Academic Discipline Policy</a>.
      <p><b>Appeals:</b> A student may appeal the finding and/or
      penalty in a decision made under Policy 70 - Student Petitions
      and Grievances (other than regarding a petition) or Policy 71 -
      Student Discipline if a ground for an appeal can be
      established. Read <a href="http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/infosec/Policies/policy72.htm">Policy 72 - Student Appeals</a>.
