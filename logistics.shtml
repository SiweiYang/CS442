      <p>The instructor in Winter 2014 is Prabhakar Ragde (UW
      userid <tt>plragde</tt>, office DC 1314, office hours TuTh 1:15-2:15).</p>
      <p>The required textbook for CS 442 is 
      <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/">Types
      and Programming Languages</a>,
      by Benjamin Pierce (MIT Press, 2002), available at the UW Bookstore.
      We will try to make more use of this book than in previous
      offerings. There will be assigned readings.
      The book does not define the course, but
      provides valuable support. The course will be a synthesis
      of various reference materials.

      <p>The lectures are arranged topically into modules of various
      lengths. Presentation slides for the modules will be available on
      the Handouts page. </p>

      <p>There will be a number of programming questions assigned (perhaps
      with some written, or more accurately, "typed" questions). 
      They will be posted on the Assignments page. We will use the
      Marmoset submission system which allows for automated testing
      and rapid feedback. Details are on the Marmoset page.
      </p>

      <p>There will be one midterm exam, on Thursday, February 27,
      2014, from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm, in rooms to be announced. 
      This is a closed-book exam.

      <p>The final mark is based on assignments (40%), the midterm
      exam (20%), and the final exam (40%).

      <p>All of the software used in the course is available free for
      most common platforms, and will be installed on the CSCF undergraduate
      environment (where tests will be run).
      <ul>
      <li>Racket: <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org">Racket 5.92</a>
      (formerly PLT Scheme);
      <li>OCaml: <a href="http://www.ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> version
      4.00 or higher;
      <li>Haskell: <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell Platform</a>
      (including GHC, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler, and associated
      tools and libraries), version 2013.2.0.0;
      </ul>

      <p>Racket comes with a good IDE for development (DrRacket).
      OCaml and Haskell do not, though they have command-line
      interpreters. Good language modes for OCaml and Haskell
      are available for Vim and Emacs.

      <p>Instead of a newsgroup, we will be
      using <a href="piazza.com/uwaterloo.ca/winter2014/cs442">Piazza</a>
      to manage questions and discussion. If you do not get a signup
      message, please locate the class and sign up with your UW email.
